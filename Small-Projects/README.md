# Small Projects

Small project is a demonstration of the computer science skills I have honed over my college career and during quarantine.  The goal of the repo is to demonstrate my competencies in a way that my resume and transcript cannot show.  Each project is of personal interest to me and also intended to demonstrate key skills of mine.

## Cassiopeia Test

Cassiopeia is a python wrapper of the Riot Games API.  I enjoy following the League of Legends solo queue professional scene and am intersted in doing an analysis of high tier solo play at the challenger level.  In order to do such an analysis I need to collect and manipulate data from the Riot Games servers using their API.  Cassiopeia test is a notebook demonstrating the method of data collection using the API service and also shows a very basic structuring of my own game data.  The goal of this small project is to show my basic understanding of requesting data from API's and storing it efficiently.  While doing this project I learned about working with rate limits and secure API keys.

## Optimization

This project is a result of my computer architecture class in college. In that class we talked extensively about techniques to increase the efficiency of a program through numerous techniques.  In order to demonstrate what I learned about this I am currently creating a small demonstration comparing the speed of a 500X500 matrix multiplication.  The final code will run a 500X500 multiplication on random numbers multiple times and compare the average time of four approaches.
1.) Standard python implementation
2.) Standard C implemenation
3.) Multithreaded C implemenation
4.) GPU optimized (Cuda)
