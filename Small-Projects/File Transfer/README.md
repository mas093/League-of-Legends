## File Transfer

This was the middle of term project in my computer networking class.  The protocol was designed by myself and my classmate Matt Turconi.  The goal of the project was to create a reliable transfer protocol built on top of an unreliable tranfer protocol.  We designed a protocol built on top of UDP which breaks a file into packets and will send packets in bursts.  Once a burst is fully acknowledged by the reciever the next burst will be sent.  

This approach creates reliability because new bursts will not be sent until the previous burst has been fully recieved.  Each packet in a burst has headers which assure all packets will be ordered properly and no packets will be dropped.

In order to test our solution we used the udp_box.py program to simulate poor transfers.  The udp_box can simulate packet loss, bit flipping, out of order sending, etc. This allowed us to benchmark our solution under multiple conditions. The results are seen in results_-_sheet1.pdf.  The results were generated by transfering test.txt which is a lorem ipsum file.
